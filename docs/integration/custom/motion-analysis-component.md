### KinesteX Motion Recognition: Real-Time Engagement

- **Interactive Tracking**: Advanced motion recognition for immersive fitness experiences.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instantly track reps, spot mistakes, and calculate calories burned.  
- **Boost Motivation**: Keep users engaged with detailed exercise feedback.  
- **Custom Integration**: Adapt camera placement to fit your appâ€™s design.  

## **CAMERA Integration Example**

### **1. Displaying the KinesteX Camera Component**

```swift
KinesteXAIFramework.createCameraComponent(
    apiKey: apiKey,
    companyName: company,
    userId: userId,
    exercises: arrayAllExercises, // string array with all exercises, ex. ["Squats", "Lunges"...]
    currentExercise: currentExerciseString, // current exercise (starting)
    user: nil,
    isLoading: $isLoading,
    onMessageReceived: { message in
        switch message {
        case .reps(let value):
            reps = value["value"] as? Int ?? 0
        case .mistake(let value):
            mistake = value["value"] as? String ?? "--"
        default:
            break
        }
    }
)
```

### **2. Updating the Current Exercise**
Easily update the exercise being tracked through a function:

```swift
KinesteXAIFramework.updateCurrentExercise(currentExercise) // switch current exercise name in real-time (ex. "Lunges")
```

### **3. Handling Messages for Reps and Mistakes**
Track repetitions and identify mistakes made by users in real time:

```swift
KinesteXAIFramework.createCameraComponent(
    // ...
    onMessageReceived: { message in
        switch message {
          // provides current rep value for the exercise
        case .reps(let value):
            reps = value["value"] as? Int ?? 0
          // provides mistake value in real-time and speaks it to the person
        case .mistake(let value):
            mistake = value["value"] as? String ?? "--"
        // handing custom types
        case .custom_type(let value):
            guard let receivedType = value["type"] else {
                return
            }

            if let typeString = receivedType as? String {
                switch typeString {
                case "models_loaded":
                    print("ALL MODELS LOADED")
                case "person_in_frame":
                // person got into the silhouette frame
                    withAnimation {
                        personInFrame = true
                    }
                default:
                    break
                }
            }

        default:
            break
        }
    }
)

```

## Additional customization options you can pass in customParams: 
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `videoURL` | If videoURL is specified, we will use it instead of camera |
| `landmarkColor` | Color of the pose connections and landmarks. Has to be in hex format with #. Example: "#14FF00" |
| `showSilhouette` | Whether or not to show the silhouette component prompting a user to get into the frame |
| `includePoseData` | string[]. Can contain either or all: ["angles", "poseLandmarks", "worldLandmarks"]. If "angles" is included, will return both 2D and 3D angles for specified poseLandmarks or/and worldLandmarks. **THIS WILL IMPACT PERFORMANCE**, so only include if you are planning to make custom calculations instead of relying on our existing exercises |

## Available message types that will be returned: 
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `error_occurred` | includes `data` field with the error message |
| `warning` | Warning if exercise IDs models are not provided |
| `successful_repeat` | to indicate success rep, includes: `exercise` representative of currentExercise value, and `value` with an integer value of the total number of reps for the current exercise |
| `person_in_frame` | To indicate that person is in the frame |
| `pose_landmarks` | *If specified in includePoseData.* Includes `poseLandmarks` Object. Inside it has `coordinates`, `angles2D`, and `angles3D`. See below for all coordinate values |
| `world_landmarks` | *If specified in includePoseData.* Includes `worldLandmarks` Object. Inside it has `coordinates`, `angles2D`, and `angles3D`. See below for all coordinate values |

## Available coordinates and angles if includePoseData is used. 
Both poseLandmarks and worldLandmarks contain same naming conventions for coordinates and angles, but have different values depending because the point of reference is different. worldLandmarks are useful if you need to perform calculations regardless of the person's position in the camera frame since the main point of reference would be hips and person will be treated as always in the center of the frame. worldLandmarks have the most accurate z measurements. poseLandmarks are useful if you need to know person's position relative to the camera frame. 

- Available coordinates:
  ```js
  nose: Landmark;
  leftEyeInner: Landmark;
  leftEye: Landmark;
  leftEyeOuter: Landmark;
  rightEyeInner: Landmark;
  rightEye: Landmark;
  rightEyeOuter: Landmark;
  leftEar: Landmark;
  rightEar: Landmark;
  mouthLeft: Landmark;
  mouthRight: Landmark;
  leftShoulder: Landmark;
  rightShoulder: Landmark;
  leftElbow: Landmark;
  rightElbow: Landmark;
  leftWrist: Landmark;
  rightWrist: Landmark;
  leftPinky: Landmark;
  rightPinky: Landmark;
  leftIndex: Landmark;
  rightIndex: Landmark;
  leftThumb: Landmark;
  rightThumb: Landmark;
  leftHip: Landmark;
  rightHip: Landmark;
  leftKnee: Landmark;
  rightKnee: Landmark;
  leftAnkle: Landmark;
  rightAnkle: Landmark;
  leftHeel: Landmark;
  rightHeel: Landmark;
  leftFootIndex: Landmark;
  rightFootIndex: Landmark;

  ```
  Each Landmark has `x`, `y`, `z`, and `visibility` fields with values from 0 to 1 indicative of person's position or visibility of the given landmark
  - Available angles both in 2D using x and y coordinates and 3D using x, y, z. 
```js
    leftKneeAngle: number;
    rightKneeAngle: number;
    leftHipAngle: number;
    rightHipAngle: number;
    leftShoulderAngle: number;
    rightShoulderAngle: number;
    leftElbowAngle: number;
    rightElbowAngle: number;
    leftWristAngle: number;
    rightWristAngle: number;
    leftAnkleAngle: number;
    rightAnkleAngle: number;
```
